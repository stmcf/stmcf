Iâ€™m fascinated by code, the way it can make a difference in everyday life through building innovative, user-centred products.

The CodeClan experience has provided me with a foundation and Iâ€™m looking for a company that I can develop my progress, knowledge and understanding while making a difference from the start. My prior experience may be a long way away from code however I have led or been part of successfully delivered construction projects for 16 years. Demonstrating both collaboration and leadership skills and look forward to further utilising those skills in my next role as a developer.
